# Apriori Algorithm Implementation

This Python script implements the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining. The Apriori algorithm is widely used for finding frequent itemsets and generating association rules in a dataset.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Apriori algorithm implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
3. Run the script `ap.py` to execute the Apriori algorithm on the provided dataset.
4. Explore the generated frequent itemsets and association rules.

## Code Structure

The main script is `ap.py`, which includes the implementation of the Apriori algorithm. The dataset is read from the file `data.txt`, where each line represents a transaction.

The code structure includes functions for reading data from a file, counting transactions, generating frequent itemsets, and creating association rules.

## How to Run

To execute the script, run the following command:

```bash
python ap.py

## Dataset

The provided dataset (data.txt) consists of transactions, where each line represents a transaction, and items within each transaction are separated by space.

##Results

The script will output the frequent itemsets for each iteration (C1, L1, C2, L2, and so on) and eventually display the final set of association rules that meet the confidence threshold.
